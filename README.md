# Meteorite-Landings

## Purpose of this Application:

To visually display the size and location of every meteorite
that has contacted earth.

Of course it won't be *every* meteorite, but all of those which the data
provides.

All data is being retrieved via NASA's open data portal at: https://data.nasa.gov/
